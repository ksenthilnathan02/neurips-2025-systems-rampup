# Evaluation Notes

- Classic benchmarks:
  - MMLU, GSM8K, HELM-style suites.
- Multimodal:
  - MMBench, MMMU, chart/diagram benchmarks.
- For agents:
  - Need multi-step task success metrics.
  - Measure tool-call correctness and robustness, not just single responses.
- Pain point:
  - Models improve faster than benchmarks.
  - Real progress needs better, more realistic evaluation setups.
